# FOLDS - Federation of Online Legacay Data in Seismology

## Background
Proposed metadata fields for standardizing metadata needed to support an internationally coordinated
collection system of digital legacy seismic data elements generated from analog
recordings. These standards
will make easier the work of those at collection centers creating the metadata and
at data centers that manage metadata and corresponding legacy data. However, to
manage the level of effort required for data collection centers to participate,
enough metadata is required to make legacy data Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR).


## Specification
Below is the recommended specifications by the WG2 of the FDSN (2022) proposed by Tim Ahern et al.
